# random-knowledge-test

making a quiz that asks sets of questions, the difficulty of the questions can be selected at the beginning of the quiz(level 1~5), and the questions and answers will get randomized every time when the browser refreshes. The quiz has a timer (maybe on each questions or the whole quiz), a progress bar, and shows the score at the end. If the user wants, the user can log their score at the end to track their high scores or to compete with other users.
